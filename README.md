## About
This project is an adaption of chcicken's post on [Programming a Guitar Tuner with Python][https://www.chciken.com/digital/signal/processing/2020/05/13/guitar-tuner.html].  I wanted to create a wearable "tuner", which would identify the notes and display the corresponding color to represent the note.  I am interested in trying this with different instruments, so it'll be interested to expand on the work focused on the guitar.

## Setup
